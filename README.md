# welcome

hi, i'm icy<br>
i program in a few languages; mainly c# and js (this was originally written like last year i do not remember any js)<br>

### about me
i like technology, especially older tech from the early 2000s, listening to different types of music, software-defined radio, gta v, shopping (esp fashion), drawing stuff (not actual art literally just drawing cool typography and designs all over my folders, sticky notes or school books) and making mashups

### what i like
- making weird web apps to do oddly specific things
- i want to learn how to make ds/wii homebrew apps
- jailbreaking,  mostly legacy stuff (ios 6 and below)

### languages
| Language             | How I use it                                                                                 | Example Repos                                                                                  |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| C#                   | Probably the language I am most familiar with, I use this to make Windows apps!              | None right now
| Javascript (Node.js) | I mostly use JavaScript to create bots, and I am also learning to make web apps with it                       | None right now
| Python               | Python is the main language I am learning right now, especially because I have a Raspberry Pi :)                                                                           | None right now                                                                         |
| HTML/CSS             | Making cool sites and hopefully some web apps | None right now                                                                         |


### the username
there is not much of a story behind how i got a cool username, but i feel like i should explain so it doesn't look dodgy..
in early 2020, i started coding more often and decided i wanted a new github account and obviously i wanted a cool name so i looked up 'short names available on github' and found a repo with a big list of 3 letter names which were available
they were mostly just random letters and numbers but then i saw 'duh' and was like 'there's no way' but apparently it was because here i am
my guess is that github was reserving this username or something (cos there's no way no one took it) and that i managed to somehow get it soon after it became available but i guess i'll never know
