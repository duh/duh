# welcome

hi, i'm icy<br>
i program in a few languages; mainly c# and js (this was originally written like last year i do not remember any js)<br>


### what i like
- making weird web apps to do oddly specific things
- i want to learn how to make ds/wii homebrew apps
- jailbreaking,  mostly legacy stuff (ios 6 and below)

### languages
| Language             | How I use it                                                                                 | Repos                                                                                  |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| C#                   | Probably the language I am most familiar with, I use this to make Windows apps!              | None right now
| Javascript (Node.js) | This is what I use when making bots and user scripts.                           | 
| Python               | pi stuff go brrr                                                                             | None right now                                                                         |
| HTML/CSS             | This isn't really a programming language but it's how I design the front-end of my web apps! | None right now                                                                         |


### the username
there is not much of a story behind how i got a cool username, but i feel like i should explain so it doesn't look dodgy..
in early 2020, i started coding more often and decided i wanted a new github account and obviously i wanted a cool name so i looked up 'short names available on github' and found a repo with a big list of 3 letter names which were available
they were mostly just random letters and numbers but then i saw 'duh' and was like 'there's no way' but apparently it was because here i am
my guess is that github was reserving this username or something (cos there's no way no one took it) and that i managed to somehow get it soon after it became available but i guess i'll never know
