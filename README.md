# welcome

hi, I'm a first-year Computer Science student ðŸ¤“ðŸ¤“ðŸ¤“ðŸ¤“
I have a basic understanding of many languages, but mainly focus on JS, Python, and more recently Java.

### about me
I like tech, especially older computers, listening to music, playing games, going for walks, and subway (my beloved)

### languages
| Language             | How I use it                                                                                 | Example Repos                                                                                  |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| C#                   | Probably the language I am most familiar with, I use this to make Windows apps!              | None right now
| Java                 | I am learning this in my uni course, and use it for console and GUI based applications       | None right now
| Javascript           | I haven't used JS in a while, but used to use it for bots and plan to start learning it again for web apps                       | [bubbles](https://github.com/duh/bubbles)
| Python               | Python is the main language I am learning right now, especially because I have a Raspberry Pi :)                                                                           | [lastfm-utils](https://github.com/duh/lastfm-utils), [blackjack](https://github.com/duh/blackjack), [pixelsplitter](https://github.com/duh/pixelsplitter)                                                                        |
| HTML/CSS             | Making cool sites and hopefully some web apps | [bubbles](https://github.com/duh/bubbles)                                                                 |
