# welcome

hi, i'm icy<br>
i program in a few languages; mainly c# and python<br>


### about me
i like technology, especially older tech from the early 2000s, listening to different types of music, software-defined radio, gta v, shopping (esp fashion), drawing stuff (not actual art literally just drawing cool typography and designs all over my folders, sticky notes or school books) and making mashups
<br>i am currently focusing on learning python and css

### languages
| Language             | How I use it                                                                                 | Example Repos                                                                                  |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| C#                   | Probably the language I am most familiar with, I use this to make Windows apps!              | None right now
| Javascript (Node.js) | I haven't used JS in a while, but used to use it for bots and plan to start learning it again for web apps                       | None right now
| Python               | Python is the main language I am learning right now, especially because I have a Raspberry Pi :)                                                                           | [lastfm-utils](https://github.com/duh/lastfm-utils)                                                                        |
| HTML/CSS             | Making cool sites and hopefully some web apps | None right now                                                                         |
